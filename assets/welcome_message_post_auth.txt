## What should you do first?
Start clicking on stuff in the sidebar!

The search function in the sidebar will return relevant results from the company records and answer any business questions you might have (powered by GPT). The tabs are a more guided walk through company data. Hover over any linked contacts or clients for a quick glance at status, stages, and roles.

## Want a more guided introduction?
**Take the Executive Challenge!** I'll bet you a pint that within 15 minutes you know more about the current state of this fictional business than your own!

Here is the scenario:
- You are the new CEO of NarrativAI and you need to get up to speed with the business.
- Start with the [Executive Intelligence](http://localhost:8501/Executive_Intelligence) tab (left sidebar) and browse a few recent weekly, monthly, and quarterly business reviews.
- Check out how sales are going on the [Sales Intelligence](http://localhost:8501/Sales_Intelligence) tab - you'll find prospective client summaries, contact histories, key account updates, sentiment analysis and more.
- Understand the current client mix and sentiment on the [Customer Success](http://localhost:8501/Customer_Success) tab. Check out what your current clients are up to at a glance.

## :red[COMING SOON:]
- The [Product Insights](http://localhost:8501/Product_Intelligence) tab will show you the latest product updates, feature requests, and bug reports.
- [Team Analytics](http://localhost:8501/Company_Updates) tab will show you the latest company news, employee updates, and team performance.
- Get a visual of the key metrics of your business on the [Metrics](http://localhost:8501/Metrics) tab. This will feel familiar - it is the same endless graphs you normally look at and then go ask your sales/success/revops team to explain. The difference? It all links back to the other tabs so you can get that context right away.
